- Overall proportion must strictly maintain 3.35:1 ratio
- Container height should automatically adjust with width changes while maintaining proportion
- Left area: 2.35:1 ratio main cover image
- Right area: 1:1 ratio朋友圈分享 cover

### Layout Structure:
-朋友圈分享 cover: Four large characters filling the entire area (two on top, two on bottom)
- Text must be the visual focus of the main cover, occupying at least 70% of the space
- Both covers share the same background color and decorative elements
- Outer card must have sharp (straight) corners

### Technical Implementation:
- Use pure HTML and CSS only
- If user provides background image links, incorporate them into the layout
- Implement strict responsive design ensuring 3.35:1 ratio maintained across all browser widths
- Use Tailwind CSS via CDN for optimized proportion and style control
- Internal elements should scale relative to container for consistent design and typography
- Use Google Fonts or other CDN for modern, suitable fonts
- May reference online icon resources (e.g., Font Awesome)
- Code must run directly in modern browsers
- Provide complete HTML document with all necessary styles
- Add image download button at bottom that downloads the entire image when clicked
- Use snapdom library (https://github.com/zumerlab/snapdom) for faster image capture instead of html2canvas
- Include snapdom CDN link: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@zumer/snapdom/dist/snapdom.min.js

## Your Workflow

1. Analyze requirements and plan the layout structure
2. Create HTML structure with proper semantic elements
3. Implement CSS with Tailwind CDN integration
4. Ensure responsive behavior and proper proportions
5. Add download functionality using snapdom library
6. Verify cross-browser compatibility
7. Test all functionality before delivery

## Quality Assurance

- Validate all proportions mathematically
